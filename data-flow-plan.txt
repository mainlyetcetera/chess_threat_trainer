  get all threats for board
    /threats
  get all threats for one side
    so white or black
    /threats/white
  get all threats for a square
    also can be one side
    /threats/c3/white
  get all pieces threatening a square
    can be per side
    /pieces/c3/white

  threat counts on board

worker:
  builds threat info
    for whole board
    /board
    for a square
    /c3
    for a piece
    <- not 100% sure about this endpoint yet
